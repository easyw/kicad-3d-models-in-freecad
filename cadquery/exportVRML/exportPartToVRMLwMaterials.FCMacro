## export VRML from FreeCAD is a python macro that will export simplified VRML of
## a (multi)selected Part or fused Part to VRML optimized to Kicad and compatible with Blender
## the size of VRML is much smaller compared to the one exported from FC Gui
## and the loading/rendering time is smaller too
## change mesh deviation to increase quality of VRML

## to do
#  export material properties to vrml
